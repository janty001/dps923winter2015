The app shows how to configure a 'launch' scene.

The app's entry point is the navigation controller. It has a 'root view controller' relationship to the 'launch' scene.

The 'launch' scene has buttons (or other UI). Each button segues to a specific scene ('push').

The 'launch' scene's controller includes method overrides to hide/show the navigation bar. This will be useful in the future if we want to replace the standard buttons with images or something that looks nicer.
